CSS Files
about.css: The about.css file contains the styles specific to the "About Me" page. It defines the visual layout, colors, fonts, and spacing for the elements in the about.html file. This CSS file helps create an attractive and consistent presentation for Karuna's personal information.

blog.css: The blog.css file is responsible for styling the blog.html page. It specifies the visual design of blog posts, including fonts, colors, margins, and other visual elements. This CSS ensures that the blog posts are visually appealing and easy to read.

contact.css: The contact.css file handles the styling for the contact form found in contact.html. It defines the appearance of form fields, buttons, and other form elements, ensuring that the contact page is user-friendly and visually consistent.

style.css: The style.css file contains common styles shared across all pages of the website. It may define general fonts, background colors, header styles, and other elements that are consistent across the entire site.

These HTML and CSS files work together to create a cohesive and visually appealing web experience. The HTML files structure the content and layout, while the CSS files define the visual presentation and styling. This separation of content (HTML) and style (CSS) is a fundamental principle of web development, allowing for flexibility and maintainability in designing and displaying web pages.
